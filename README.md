## **Project Overview**

This project is a modern e-commerce web application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience with a responsive UI and efficient state management. The application includes features such as user authentication, a product catalog, a shopping cart, and more.

---

## **Features**

- **User Authentication**: Login and registration with form validation.
- **Product Management**:
  - View product details.
  - Add, update, and remove items from the shopping cart.
  - Pagination and category filtering.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile.
- **State Management**: Centralized state using Zustand.
- **API Integration**: Data fetching from a RESTful API using the Fetch API.

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **`src/components`**: Reusable UI components.
- **`src/pages`**: Components for application routes (e.g., Home, Cart, Login).
- **`src/lib`**: API functions and utility methods.
- **`src/store`**: State management logic using Zustand.
- **`src/types`**: TypeScript type definitions.
